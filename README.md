This is a simple Pomodoro app I setup as an execuse to start playing with the Kivy GUI framework. I've found Kivy to be interesting and simple to use.


To run the app, set up `python 2.7.9` and `kivy 1.8.0` and the src dir run,

```
kivy maing.py
```

FYI: "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks." Read more [wikipedia],
